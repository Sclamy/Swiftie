[00:05.75]I took a chance, I took a shot
[00:10.69]And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
[00:15.37]You took a swing, I took it hard
[00:20.12]And down here from the ground, I see who you are
[00:25.00]I'm sick and tired of your attitude
[00:27.50]I'm feeling like I don't know you
[00:29.78]You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
[00:34.52]And I need you like a heartbeat
[00:37.00]But you know you got a mean streak
[00:39.42]Makes me run for cover when you're around
[00:44.19]Here's to you and your temper
[00:47.18]Yes, I remember what you said last night
[00:51.87]And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
[00:56.81]Tell me why
[00:58.01].
[01:03.45]Well, you could write a book on
[01:05.96]How to ruin someone's perfect day
[01:12.96]Well, I get so confused and frustrated
[01:16.46]Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh
[01:22.47]I'm sick and tired of your reasons
[01:25.00]I got no one to believe in
[01:27.41]You tell me that you want me, then push me around
[01:32.03]And I need you like a heartbeat
[01:34.55]But you know you got a mean streak
[01:37.02]Makes me run for cover when you're around
[01:41.78]Here's to you and your temper
[01:44.78]Yes, I remember what you said last night
[01:49.45]And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
[01:54.20]Tell me why
[01:55.62].
[01:58.68]Why do you have to make me feel small
[02:04.39]So you can feel whole inside?
[02:09.63]Why do you have to put down my dreams
[02:14.09]So you're the only thing on my mind?
[02:18.73].
[02:20.11]Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
[02:22.76]Feeling like I don't know you
[02:24.96]You tell me that you want me, and cut me down
[02:29.90]I'm sick and tired of your reasons
[02:32.33]I've got no one to believe in
[02:34.54]You ask me for my love, and you push me around
[02:39.29]Here's to you and your temper
[02:42.24]Yes, I remember what you said last night
[02:47.14]And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
[02:51.89]Tell me why (Why)
[02:56.66]Tell me why (Oh)
[03:01.13] .
[03:03.36]I take a step back, I let you go
[03:08.29]I told you I'm not bulletproof
[03:11.23]Now you know
